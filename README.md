## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The card is simple and minimalist but a project that I thought would take 5 minutes to do ended up took me longer.
The problem is I was reproducing a copy and to find out how much of padding and how much of margin and leaving everything in harmony are small details that takes time.

The HTML was very simple

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="card">
    <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="image of qr-code" />
    <div class="text-card">
      <h2></h2>
      <p></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

CSS I used root variables

```css
root {
  --white-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --lightGray-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --grayishBlue-color: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  --darkblue-color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

<!--
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
``` -->

### Continued development

I'm pretending to do another card but using react and it generate QR-Code
